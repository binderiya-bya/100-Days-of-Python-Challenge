## Caesar Cipher

# Instructions

- Ask the user whether they want to encode or decode a text, and ask a text and a shift number. 

- If the user wants to encode a text, shift each letter in the text by the shift number forward in the alphabet. 

- If the user wants to decode a text, shift each letter in the text by the shift number backward in the alphabet. 

- When the shift number is out of range of the alphabet list, then the shift number continues from the beginning of the alphabet list (in the case of encoding) or the end of the alphabet list (in the case of decoding).
