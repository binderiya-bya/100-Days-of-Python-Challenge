`Day-18-Damien-Hirst-Painting.py` creates a program using `turtle` package. It draws a spot painting using
the color palettes of contemporary artist Damien Hirst's painting saved as `Damien-Hirst-Veil-Paintings-Kew-ca-2020.jpg`.
The color palettes are created using `cologram` package.

'Day-18-turtle-and-the-GUI.py` goes through `5` challenges that uses the turtle packages to create shapes and colors.
